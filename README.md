## 1. Problem Statement

The **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** process is vital for hospitals to manage the financial side of healthcare services, ensuring they can continue providing quality care while maintaining financial stability. RCM covers the entire process, starting from when a patient books an appointment through to when the provider receives payment. This project is focused on improving the **Accounts Receivable (AR)** aspect, which tracks the money owed to the hospital by patients and insurers. [Dataset Overview](https://github.com/NilooKandi/End-to-End-Azure-Data-Architecture-Healthcare-Revenue-Cycle-Management-/blob/main/1-%20Datasets%20Overview.md)

### a. Overview of the RCM Process

1. **Patient Visit**: The RCM journey begins when a patient visits the hospital. During this visit, patient details, including **insurance information**, are collected. This helps the provider understand who is responsible for the bill – the **insurance company**, the **patient**, or both.

   **Example**:  
   - Total bill: **$20,000**  
   - Insurance pays: **$15,000**  
   - Patient owes: **$5,000**

2. **Services Provided**: After the patient visit, medical services are provided, and the hospital generates a bill.

3. **Billing and Claims Review**: The bill is sent to the insurance company for review. The insurance may approve the claim and pay in full, pay partially, or reject the claim entirely.

4. **Payments and Follow-ups**: If the insurance only covers part of the bill, the remaining balance is the patient's responsibility. The hospital will follow up with the patient to collect the outstanding amount.

5. **Tracking and Improvement**: The RCM process focuses on tracking unpaid AR and optimising the collection process, ensuring the hospital remains financially healthy.

### b. Key Challenges in Accounts Receivable (AR)

Managing **AR** is crucial for hospitals, but **patient payments** can pose significant risks. There are scenarios where the financial burden falls more heavily on patients, making it more difficult to collect outstanding payments. Some examples include:

- **Low Insurance Coverage**: When insurance providers place most of the financial responsibility on the patient, as is often the case with high-deductible policies or private clinics.
- **Dental and Private Treatments**: Non-covered services or treatments that require the patient to pay the full amount.
- **Deductibles**: When the patient is responsible for covering a portion of the medical costs before insurance kicks in.

The primary objectives of AR management are:

1. **Collect cash quickly** by securing payments as soon as possible.
2. **Minimise the collection period** – the longer the payment is overdue, the less likely the full amount will be collected (or, for example, a decrease in the overall value of the receivable due to the time value of money).

**Collection Probability** of the full amount decreases over time:
- **93%** of the owed amount is collected within **30 days**.
- **85%** is collected within **60 days**.
- **73%** is collected within **90 days**.

### c. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for AR

[Healthcare Accounts Receivable Management](https://mdmanagementgroup.com/healthcare-accounts-receivable-management/)

- **Risk Factors Analysis**: Analyse delayed payments and identify factors (e.g., insurance delays, patient financial responsibility) contributing to AR inefficiencies.
- **KPIs for AR**: Track critical KPIs such as outstanding payments, delayed claims, and payment status (e.g., paid, pending, denied).
To effectively manage AR, hospitals track KPIs such as:

1. **AR > 90 days**: This KPI measures how much of the total AR is overdue by more than 90 days.
   - **Example**:  
     - Total AR: **$1,000,000**  
     - AR > 90 days: **$200,000**  
     - Overdue Ratio: **200K / 1M = 20%**

2. **Days in AR**: This KPI tracks how long it takes to collect the AR.
   - **Example**:  
     - Total AR: **$1,000,000**  
     - AR collected in **100 days**:  
       - **$400,000 AR**  
       - **Collection rate**: **$10,000/day**  
       - **Target days in AR**: **45 days**

### d. Data Engineering Objectives

Given the complexity and variety of data sources involved in the RCM process (e.g., patient records, insurance claims, billing details, and payment transactions), there is a need to create a robust **end-to-end data pipeline**. This pipeline will collect, process, and structure data to enable accurate reporting on AR performance.

The primary goals of this project are to:

- **Ingest data** from various sources, such as patient records, insurance claims, billing information, and payment history.
- **Transform** raw data into structured formats to create **fact tables** and **dimension tables** that will support AR analysis.
- **Generate KPIs** like **AR > 90 days** and **Days in AR** to help the reporting team monitor and assess AR performance.
- Provide insights to help **reduce collection periods**, improve cash flow, and ultimately enhance the financial health of hospitals.

## 2. Infrastructure and Architecture
### a. System Architecture

This project utilises a modern cloud-based data platform leveraging several Azure services:
- **Azure SQL Database** houses the source EMR data for the two hospitals.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)** acts as the central data repository, storing data across the different layers of the Medallion architecture.
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** orchestrates the end-to-end data pipeline, including data ingestion, transformation, and loading.
- **Azure Databricks** provides a platform for data processing, cleansing, transformation, and creating fact and dimension tables, leveraging its integration with Delta Lake.
- **Azure Key Vault** securely stores sensitive information like access keys and connection strings, enhancing security and compliance.
- **Unity Catalog** serves as the centralised metadata repository, providing a unified view of data assets across the workspace.

### c. Medallion Architecture

The solution leverages the **Medallion Architecture**, comprising three key layers: **Landing**, **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**, each with distinct responsibilities.
**1. Landing Layer**

- **Purpose**: Serves as the entry point exclusively for claims data in CSV format, uploaded by insurance providers.
- **Data Format**: CSV files
- **Key Characteristics**: Immutable, raw data; no processing or transformation applied.

**2. Bronze Layer (Source of Truth)**

- **Purpose**: The Bronze layer serves as the initial zone for raw data from EMR (Azure SQL DB) and NPI, ICD, and CPT (public API). It stores data in its native format with minimal transformations, ensuring immutability and serving as the single source of truth for downstream processes.
  
- **Data Sources**:
    - **EMR Data**: Ingested from Azure SQL DB in Parquet format.
    - **NPI and ICD Codes**: Extracted from public APIs and stored in Parquet format.
    - **CPT Code Data**: Obtained from a public API in Parquet format.

- **Data Format**: All datasets in the Bronze layer are stored in **Parquet** format, which offers efficient storage and optimal query performance for large datasets.

- **Key Characteristics**:
    - Data is **immutable**, preserving the original raw format.
    - Acts as the **single source of truth** for all downstream processes.

**3. Silver Layer (Clean and Enriched Data)**

- **Purpose**: The Silver layer contains cleaned, enriched, and standardized data ready for analysis and reporting.
  
- **Key Processes**:
    - **Data Cleaning**: Null values are handled, data quality checks are applied, and bad records are quarantined.
    - **Common Data Model (CDM)**: Standardises data from different sources to resolve schema discrepancies and potential ID clashes (e.g., patient tables from different hospitals).
    - **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2**: Maintains historical records, ensuring that changes in patient demographics or other data are properly tracked.
    - **Data Storage in Delta Tables**: Transformed data is stored in Delta tables in the silver layer. Delta tables, built on top of Parquet and incorporated additional logs, provide ACID transactions, support for data updates, efficient incremental loads, and versioned data history.

**4. Gold Layer (Facts and Dimensions)**

- **Purpose**: The Gold layer contains curated, aggregated data modelled into fact and dimension tables for business reporting and KPI generation.

- **Key Processes**:
    - Creation of **fact tables**, such as `fact_transaction`, to capture key business events.
    - Development of **dimension tables**, like `dim_patient`, `dim_provider`, `dim_department`, `dim_encounter`, `dim_icd_codes`, `dim_claims`, `dim_cpt_codes`, and `dim_npi` to provide context and details for the facts.

- **Data Format**: Data is stored in **Delta tables**, optimised for reporting and analytical queries.

```


## 5. Pipeline Implementation

### a. Source to Landing 
The landing layer serves as a staging area for raw data provided by external sources in flat file formats, specifically CSV files containing claims data and CPT codes data. In addition to the raw data in the landing layer, a config file in CSV format is also stored within a specific container ("configs") and directory ("emr") in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. This config file is crucial for driving the metadata-driven architecture of the data pipeline. It contains information about each data source such as database name, source type (Hospital A or B), table name, load type (full or incremental), watermark column, active status, and target path. The pipeline reads this config file and uses the metadata to dynamically control the data ingestion process. This approach makes the pipeline more flexible and adaptable to different data sources and loading scenarios.

### b. Bronze Layer

The bronze layer stores all data in parquet format, including:
- EMR data ingested directly from Azure SQL databases.
- Claims data and CPT codes data transformed from CSV in the landing layer.
- NPI and ICD codes data fetched directly from APIs.
The bronze layer acts as the source of truth, containing all datasets in a consistent and optimised format.

- **API Data Integration**
  - [ICD Codes Extract](https://github.com/NilooKandi/End-to-End-Azure-Data-Architecture-Healthcare-Revenue-Cycle-Management-/blob/main/Notebooks/2-%20API%20Extracts/ICD%20Code%20API%20extract.ipynb)

### c. Silver Layer

The **silver** layer focuses on refining and transforming the raw data from the bronze layer to prepare it for downstream consumption. This involves:

*   **Data cleaning**: Invalid, null, and duplicate records are removed to ensure data quality.
*   **Standardisation**: Data formats are standardized to align with the Common Data Model for consistency and compatibility.
*   **Common Data Model (CDM) Implementation**: Data from different hospitals with varying schemas are brought under a common schema, sometimes involving the creation of surrogate keys. 
*   **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 Implementation**:  Historical changes in the data are tracked using SCD Type 2 logic, which involves maintaining a history of changes over time by adding new records with updated information and marking previous records as inactive. 
*   **Storage**: Transformed data is stored in Delta tables to support ACID transactions, incremental loads, and versioning.

Notebooks located in the "Silver" folder within the Databricks workspace detail the logic and code used for these transformations. The silver layer delivers clean, standardized, enriched data suitable for further analytics and consumption by data scientists or data analysts. [See all notebooks and transformations in the **Silver Layer**](https://github.com/NilooKandi/End-to-End-Azure-Data-Architecture-Healthcare-Revenue-Cycle-Management-/tree/main/Notebooks/3-%20Silver) 


### d. Gold Layer

The **gold** layer represents the final stage of data refinement in this project, delivering data that is ready for consumption by business users and reporting tools. Key characteristics of this layer include:

*   **Purpose**: The gold layer focuses on creating **fact and dimension tables** that facilitate efficient querying and analysis for business intelligence and reporting purposes. It aims to provide a curated and structured data model aligned with specific business requirements and KPIs. 
*   **Data Source**: It receives data from the **silver** layer, drawing upon the cleaned, standardised, and enriched datasets prepared in the previous stage.
*   **Transformations**: While the gold layer may include aggregations depending on the specific requirements, this project focuses on structuring the data into fact and dimension tables for reporting. This ensures that data is presented in a format readily understandable and usable by business users. 
*   **Data Quality**: The gold layer maintains the high data quality achieved in the silver layer by only including records marked as `is_current = true` and `is_quarantined = false`. This ensures that only the most recent and validated data is used for reporting and analysis. 
*   **Storage**: Similar to the silver layer, the gold layer uses **Delta tables** for storage, ensuring ACID compliance, efficient incremental loading, and data versioning. 
*   **Accessibility**: Business users and reporting teams primarily utilise the gold layer. The structured data model enables them to efficiently perform complex queries, generate reports, and calculate critical business metrics, ultimately supporting data-driven decision-making processes. 

Notebooks located in the "Gold" folder within the Databricks workspace document the logic and code used for transforming data from the silver layer into the desired fact and dimension table structure in the gold layer. [See all notebooks and transformations in the **Gold Layer**](https://github.com/NilooKandi/End-to-End-Azure-Data-Architecture-Healthcare-Revenue-Cycle-Management-/tree/main/Notebooks/4-%20Gold)


## 6. End-to-End Pipeline Implementation

The end-to-end pipeline in this project orchestrates the entire data journey from raw data ingestion to the creation of refined fact and dimension tables for reporting and analysis. The pipeline, named "pl_end_to_end_hc" in the Azure Data Factory, consists of two main execution pipelines:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e28d12fa-b810-4ca4-bef8-ace374b37d94)

1.  **`exec_pl_emr_src_to_landing`**: This pipeline focuses on moving data from the source Azure SQL databases (EMR data) to the bronze layer of the data lake. This pipeline was developed in Part 1 of the project and leverages a metadata-driven approach. It reads the `loadconfig.csv` file from the "configs/emr" folder in the data lake. This config file contains metadata about the source tables and dictates how the data should be ingested.  The pipeline iterates through the config file, checks for the existence of files, archives existing parquet files, and then loads the data into the bronze layer in parquet format based on the specified load type (full or incremental).

    *   The pipeline implements **parallelism** for efficient data loading, processing multiple tables concurrently.
    *   It also incorporates **active/inactive flags** from the config file, allowing specific tables to be excluded from the ingestion process.
    *   The pipeline utilises **Azure Key Vault** to securely store and access credentials, enhancing the security of the data pipeline.
2.  **`exec_pl_silver_to_gold`**: This pipeline handles the transformation and refinement of data from the silver layer to the gold layer, ultimately creating the fact and dimension tables. This pipeline primarily executes Databricks notebooks that perform a series of data manipulation tasks.

    *   **Bronze to Silver**:  Notebooks in the "Silver" folder within the Databricks workspace handle the transformation of data from the bronze layer to the silver layer. Key steps in this stage include data cleaning, standardization, implementation of a common data model, and the implementation of Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 logic to track historical changes.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e0305f1-7cbc-4a0e-85fe-48c0b0af9c64)

    *   **Silver to Gold**: Notebooks in the "Gold" folder are responsible for creating the final fact and dimension tables in the gold layer. This process involves selecting the latest records (marked as `is_current = true` and `is_quarantined = false`) from the silver layer, ensuring that only high-quality and current data is used for reporting and analysis.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ccc437a-712c-401b-a9c7-bbb744ede3ad)

**Key Features of the End-to-End Pipeline**:

*   **Medallion Architecture**: The pipeline adheres to the medallion architecture, with data flowing sequentially through the landing, bronze, silver, and gold layers, each serving a specific purpose.
*   **Metadata-Driven**: The pipeline is driven by metadata defined in a configuration file, making it adaptable to different data sources and loading scenarios.
*   **Parquet and Delta Table Utilization**: The pipeline utilizes Parquet format in the bronze layer for optimized storage and query performance, and Delta tables in the silver and gold layers to ensure ACID properties and efficient data management.
*   **Best Practices Implementation**: The pipeline incorporates best practices such as the use of Azure Key Vault for secure credential management, parallelism for efficient execution, and retries to handle potential failures.

The end-to-end pipeline exemplifies a robust and scalable data engineering solution, showcasing best practices and industry-standard techniques for handling data ingestion, transformation, and refinement in an Azure environment. The resulting gold layer provides business users with a curated and trusted source of data for reporting, analysis, and informed decision-making.
