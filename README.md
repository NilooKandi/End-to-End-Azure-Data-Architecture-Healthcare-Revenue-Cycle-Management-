# End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline for Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) on Azure
## Project Architecture




## Project Overview

This project focuses on building an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** for **Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** using the **Azure data engineering stack**. **RCM** encompasses the financial aspects of healthcare, from **patient appointment scheduling** to **provider payment**. 

The project aims to address a critical challenge faced by healthcare providersâ€”ensuring their **financial health** by optimizing **accounts receivable (AR)**. **Patient payment** is one of the key risk factors in the **RCM** process, as **insurance companies** tend to pay promptly, but **patients** often have delayed or uncollected payments.

## Problem Statement

The **accounts receivable (AR)** process is critical for maintaining the financial stability of healthcare providers. One of the main risks in RCM is the **uncollected patient payments**, especially when the patient must pay in full or partially. Delayed or uncollected payments can lead to substantial financial losses for hospitals.

This project aims to develop a data engineering pipeline that processes healthcare data to generate key insights that help hospitals improve the AR process, mitigate risks, and ultimately **optimize the RCM** process.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to create a comprehensive **data pipeline** that processes healthcare data from multiple sources and produces actionable insights for the **RCM team**. Specifically, the project will:

- **Generate Fact and Dimension Tables**: Build a data model with facts and dimensions that support reporting and analytics related to AR.
- **Create KPIs for AR**: Develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help the reporting team monitor hospital finances, track AR status, and identify delayed or uncollected payments.
- **Analyze Payment Risks**: Identify and analyze factors contributing to delayed or uncollected patient payments, helping optimize hospital revenue.
- **Optimize Financial Performance**: Provide insights into process improvements that reduce the risk of uncollected payments and improve financial outcomes for the hospital.

## RCM Process Flow

The **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** process in this project begins when a **patient visits** a healthcare provider. Here's a high-level breakdown of the RCM process and its key components:

### 1. **RCM Process**

- **Patient Visit**: The process begins with a patient visit to the hospital. During this visit, patient details, particularly **insurance coverage**, are collected.
- **Payment Responsibility**: Based on the patient details, the payment responsibility (e.g., **insurance**, **patient**, or both) is determined, which is crucial for understanding how payments are handled.

### 2. **Accounts Receivable (AR)**

- **Accounts Receivable**: AR represents the money owed to hospitals by patients and insurance companies. Managing AR effectively is critical to maintaining financial health.
- **Risk Factors**: One major risk in RCM is **uncollected patient payments**, which can negatively impact hospital finances, especially in cases where patients are responsible for partial or full payment.

## Data Engineering Pipeline Overview

This project utilizes the **Azure Data Engineering stack** to build a scalable and efficient pipeline that processes, stores, and analyzes healthcare data. The pipeline consists of several key stages:

### **1. Data Ingestion**
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** is used to orchestrate and manage data workflows, pulling in data from different sources (e.g., patient records, insurance claims, and payment data).

### **2. Data Transformation**
- **Azure Databricks** is used for data processing and transformation. The raw data is cleaned, aggregated, and enriched to build key metrics such as AR balances and payment delays.

### **3. Data Storage**
- **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Synapse Analytics** are used to store structured data. Fact and dimension tables are created in the data warehouse to support querying and reporting.

### **4. Reporting and Analytics**
- **Power BI** is used to visualize key metrics and create reports that help the RCM team monitor hospital performance and identify areas for improvement.

### **5. Key Metrics**
- **KPIs for AR**: Track critical KPIs such as outstanding payments, delayed claims, and payment status (e.g., paid, pending, denied).
- **Risk Factors Analysis**: Analyze delayed payments and identify factors (e.g., insurance delays, patient financial responsibility) contributing to AR inefficiencies.

## Tools and Technologies

This project leverages the following **Azure tools and technologies**:

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Data orchestration, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- **Azure Databricks**: Data processing and transformation using Spark.
- **Azure SQL Database**: Relational database for structured data storage.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Data warehousing for scalable data storage and analytics.
- **Power BI**: Reporting and dashboarding for KPIs and analytics.
- **Python & SQL**: For writing transformation scripts and data querying.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:






This project implements an end-to-end Azure data engineering pipeline to optimise the Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) process. The pipeline ingests, processes, and transforms data from various sources, including electronic medical records (EMR), claims data, and medical code APIs, to generate insightful reports and KPIs for improved financial performance.
